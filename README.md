## Max Roberts-Dear

#### Full Stack Developer

I am a keen technologist looking for new challenges and craving innovation. Although my core competencies are in JavaScript and Ruby, my main asset is my pragmatic problem solving aptitude. There are always new frameworks and technologies, but these can be learned if you have a good understanding of systems and patterns. I enjoy solving problems and architecting solutions and my years of experience as an engineering consultant have taught me the importance of keeping the business problem that you are trying to solve in perspective.

#### Experience in the following industry best-practices:

- **Agile:** [Acebook](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard) - Pair programming, Mobbing, Scrum, Sprint planning (see [Wiki](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard/wiki#week2Wednesday))
- **Test- Driven Development:** [Bank-Tech-Test](LINK) - Feature tests, Unit Tests, 100% Test Coverage
- **Unit Testing:** [Echo-Tech-Test](LINK) - Mocks, Stubs
- **Automated Testing & Deployment**  - [Acebook](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard) - CICD using Travis and Heroku, respectively.

#### Problem Solving
- Creative problem solver and analytical skills, studying MEng Electronics & Electrical. engineering, I have applied technical skills in digital logic design, software and hardware. 
- Working as an engineering consultant, I liaise with stakeholders and design engineering solutions to meet the scope of their requirements. 
- Honed and apply a systematic approach to solving new problems using good industry practices at makers academy.

#### Independent Learner
- Work autonomously - demonstrated by my taking initiatite to to Self-learn python, javascript, C to deliver electronics projects & build automation tools. 
- Enjoy working in a collaborative environment where new ideas are valued.
- Language agnostic and can apply software patterns/principles in rails, javascript, react to deliver makers academy projects. 
- Passion to learn exciting modern technologies with an experience working with web development stack.

## <a name = "drivers">What Drives Me - Motivations and Background</a> 

Highly interested in technologies that bring about positive change. 

My passion for progressive technologies motivated me to apply my knowledge of mechanics to the biochemical engineering field for the final year project of my degree. Using the skills that I acquired from my Masters of Mechanical Engineering course and the knowledge I gained studying biomechanics during the summer, I built a [lung-on-a-chip](LINK).

Relevance to software engineering: I developed the skill of learning by context. For example, I had never worked with human cells before and these formed an intrinsic part of my project. Knowing exactly what type of cells I needed and what I wanted to do with them (ensure good adhesion to a membrane that I fabricated using a laser as well as subject the cells to the mechanical forces that mimic the forces they would experience in the human body), I was able to acquire the knowledge I needed without having to read the whole book on cell biology. 

Wanting to enact positive change, I sought out a career in sustainable development. Joining AECOM's building services team as an engineering consultant, I liaised with stakeholders and multi-disciplinary teams to deliver energy efficient buildings on time, to spec, and on budget.

Relevance to software engineering: working to tight deadlines sharpened my communication skills within multi-disciplinary teams. My aptitude for communicating technical information to an audience without the relevant background was quickly recognised by my line-manager and resulted in me representing AECOM at client meetings and leading the mechanical discipline at workshops with architects, structural, and electrical engineers. 

In the pursuit of a more challenging career, I decided upon Software engineering (and wrote a [blog post](LINK) about what led my to this decision). TLDR: more challenging, greater variation in work, faster paced environment, young (and exciting) industry.
