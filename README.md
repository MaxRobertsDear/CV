#### Software Engineering Developer

I am a keen technologist looking for new challenges and craving innovation. Although my core competencies are in JavaScript and Ruby, my main asset is my pragmatic problem solving aptitude. There are always new frameworks and technologies, but these can be learned if you have a good understanding of systems and patterns. I enjoy solving problems and architecting solutions and my years of experience as an engineering consultant have taught me the importance of keeping the business problem that you are trying to solve in perspective.


#### What I'm looking for in a team

* Collaborative environment - where alternative schools of thought are valued.
* Celebrated innovation -  through the sharing of new ideas with the wider tech community via Meetups. 
  * Not done currently? I have experience in organising events and would love to kickstart this.
* Technologically relevent - by staying up to date with the latest tools and industry best practice. 
  * I organised the Continual Professional Development at my previous firm, and would happily do so again.
* Social environment - I want to know the team members as more than colleagues. 
  * Not got a big drinking culture? That's fine. Climbing and white water rafting are just as fun!

#### Experience in the following industry best practices:

* **Agile:** [Acebook](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard) - Stand Ups, Sprints, Pair programming, Mobbing (see [Wiki](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard/wiki)).
* **Test- Driven Development:** [Bank-Tech-Test](LINK), [Echo-Tech-Test](LINK) - Feature tests, Unit Tests, Mocks, Stubs.
* **Pair Programming:**  - I enjoy pairing and have received [positive feedback](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/Pair-Programming-Feedback/blob/master/README.md).
* **Automated Testing & Deployment**  - [Acebook](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard) - CICD using Travis and Heroku, respectively.

#### Software Engineering Course: Makers Academy (2019)

In the pursuit of a more challenging career, I decided upon Software engineering (and wrote a [blog post](https://www.maxrobertsdear.com/mech-to-software/) about it). 
* TLDR: more challenging, greater variation in work, faster paced environment, young (and exciting) industry.

The self-led curriculum at Makers Academy developed my skills in applying a methodical approach to solving new problems using industry best practice:

* [OOP](BLOGLINK) [TDD](BLOGLINK), [MVC](BLOGLINK)
* [Agile](BLOGLINK), [Extreme Programming (XP)](BLOGLINK)
* Version control (Git)
* Web standards accessibility 




#### MEng in Mechanical Engineering: University of Sheffield (September 2011 to June 2016)

* Problem-Solving - strengthened my ability to break computational challenges down into simple steps.  
  * Exemplified by the high grades achieved across the board in Mathematics. 
  


| Module | Grade |
| :----: | :---: |
| Essential Mathematics Skills and Techniques | 1st |
| Computational Mathematics | 1st |
| Mathematics for Engineering Modelling | 1st |


This aptitude has served me well in algorithm design. I break the logic down into increasingly smaller steps. I continue this process until the code required to compute a step can be written on a single line (e.g. [JARVIS](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/Jarvis-App)).

**Master's Final Year Project**  
My passion for progressive technologies led me to build a [lung-on-a-chip](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxrobertsdear/#experience-section) (Experience Section - Research Assistant).

* Rapid learning - I learned an entirely new discipline, biochemical engineering, for my final year project. 
* Prototyping - I fabricated a simple example to familiarise myself with the process before adding complexity. 
* Attention to detail - I was working to the micro mm (1×10^−6 m) to ensure a laminar flow along the channels.
* Collaborative growth - though I completed the project alone, I reached out for guidance in lab methodologies.

#### Mechanical Engineering Consultant (London September 2016 to April 2019)
To enact positive change, I sought out a career in sustainable development. 

* Communication - I liaised with stakeholders and multi-disciplinary teams to deliver energy efficient buildings on time, to spec, and on budget.
* Presentation - I produced content for and presented at client meetings.
* Workshops -  I led the mechanical discipline at external project workshops with multi-disciplinary teams.
* Technical reports - I wrote technical reports for clients, outlining design intent and case studies.
* Up-skilling - I mentored junior engineers and organised CPD's to keep my team up-to-date technologically.
