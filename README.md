## Max Roberts-Dear

#### Full Stack JavaScript Developer

I am a keen technologist looking for new challenges and craving innovation. Although my core competencies are in JavaScript and Ruby, my main asset is my pragmatic problem solving aptitude. There are always new frameworks and technologies, but these can be learned if you have a good understanding of systems and patterns. I enjoy solving problems and architecting solutions and my years of experience as an engineering consultant have taught me the importance of keeping the business problem that you are trying to solve in perspective.



#### What I'm looking for in a job role

* An opportunity to contribute from day 1. 
* An opportunity to enact measurable change.
* To see projects from concept to delivery.
* Different challenges from week to week.

#### What I'm looking for in a team

* A collaborative environment where alternative schools of thought are valued.
* An environment that celebrates innovation by sharing new ideas with the wider tech community via Meetups. 
  * If this is not something that is currently offered but is being considered, then I have experience in organising events and have links with influential speakers, especially for front-end development. 
* A team that prides itself on staying ahead of the curve and uses the latest tools available. 
  * I took charge of organising the Continual Professional Development (CPD's) at my previous firm, and would be happy to do so again to ensure that the team is aware of the latest trends and industry practices. 
* A social environment - if we are to work together 40+ hours per week, I want to know the team members as more than colleagues. 
  * Not got a big drinking culture? That's fine. Climbing and white water rafting are just as fun!

#### Experience in the following industry best practices:

* **Agile:** [Acebook](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard) - Pair programming, Mobbing, Scrum, Sprint planning (see [Wiki](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard/wiki))
* **Test- Driven Development:** [Bank-Tech-Test](LINK) - Feature tests, Unit Tests, 100% Test Coverage
* **Unit Testing:** [Echo-Tech-Test](LINK) - Mocks, Stubs
* **Automated Testing & Deployment**  - [Acebook](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard) - CICD using Travis and Heroku, respectively.


#### Problem Solving
* With a background in engineering, my creative problem solving and analytical skills were developed during my MEng Mechanical Engineering. These skills were then honed throughout my years working as an engineering consultant. 
  * The intensive software engineering course at Makers Academy provided an environment for me to adapt these core skills to building web applications. 
* During my time as an engineering consultant, I liaised with clients and developed pragmatic engineering solutions to meet the scope of their requirements. 
  * Working with progressive architects (such as Calatrava), this included designing [novel solutions](https://www.greenwichpeninsula.co.uk/whats-on/the-peninsulist/peninsula-place/) in order to deliver the desired aesthetic of a building. 
* Developed industry best practices in approaching new challenges by adopting [Extreme Programming Values](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html) and agile working methodologies during my time working on group projects at Makers Academy [example documentation](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard/wiki) 



## <a name = "drivers">What Drives Me - Motivations and Background</a> 

Highly interested in technologies that bring about positive change. 

My passion for progressive technologies motivated me to apply my knowledge of mechanics to the biochemical engineering field for the final year project of my degree. Using the skills that I acquired from my Masters of Mechanical Engineering course and the knowledge I gained studying biomechanics during the summer, I built a [lung-on-a-chip](LINK).

Relevance to software engineering: I developed the skill of learning by context. For example, I had never worked with human cells before and these formed an intrinsic part of my project. Knowing exactly what type of cells I needed and what I wanted to do with them (ensure good adhesion to a membrane that I fabricated using a laser as well as subject the cells to the mechanical forces that mimic the forces they would experience in the human body), I was able to acquire the knowledge I needed without having to read the whole book on cell biology. 

Wanting to enact positive change, I sought out a career in sustainable development. Joining AECOM's building services team as an engineering consultant, I liaised with stakeholders and multi-disciplinary teams to deliver energy efficient buildings on time, to spec, and on budget.

Relevance to software engineering: working to tight deadlines sharpened my communication skills within multi-disciplinary teams. My aptitude for communicating technical information to an audience without the relevant background was quickly recognised by my line-manager and resulted in me representing AECOM at client meetings and leading the mechanical discipline at workshops with architects, structural, and electrical engineers. 

In the pursuit of a more challenging career, I decided upon Software engineering (and wrote a [blog post](LINK) about what led my to this decision). TLDR: more challenging, greater variation in work, faster paced environment, young (and exciting) industry.

#### Software Engineering Course: Makers Academy (2019)

The self-led curriculum at Makers Academy developed my skills in applying a methodical approach to solving new problems using industry best practice. 


##### Methodologies

- OOP, TDD, MVC
- Agile, Extreme Programming


##### Technologies

- Ruby, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, React
- Node, Rails
- Express, Sinatra
- RSpec, Jasmine, Testing without libraries, Cypress, Enzyme
- PostgresQL



#### MEng in Mechanical Engineering: University of Sheffield (September 2011 to June 2016)
##### Software related modules: Essential Mathematics Skills and Techniques (Grade achieved: 1st), Computational Mathematics (Grade achieved: 1st), Mathematics for Engineering Modelling (Grade achieved: 1st)

At university, I cemented my aptitude for problem solving. My ability to break computational challenges down into simple steps is exemplified by the high grades achieved across the board in Mathematics. 

This aptitude has served me well when thinking about algorithm design. Given a problem, I break the logic required to return the desired output for a given input into increasingly smaller steps. I continue this process until I am happy that I can write the code required to compute a step on a single line of code.

#### Mechanical Engineering Consultant (London September 2016 to April 2019)
During my 2.5 years working as an engineering consultant at AECOM, ranked number 1 in the Engineering News Record, I liaised with clients and designed engineering solutions to meet the scope of their requirements.

- Collaborated with engineers, contractors and architects to design the mechanical infrastructure for commercial and residential building projects as well as mission-critical projects such as data centres.
- Developed models and calculations to carry out energy efficiency assessments and cost planning in order to deliver effective professional services and drive efficient solutions.
- Led mechanical design and built 3D models to support energy efficiency calculations and to communicate design intent to clients and architects.
- Chaired meetings with clients and workshops with other engineering disciplines to confirm project requirements.
