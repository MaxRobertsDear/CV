## Max Roberts-Dear

#### Full Stack Developer

I am a keen technologist looking for new challenges and craving innovation. Although my core competencies are in JavaScript and Ruby, I see my main asset as being my pragmatic problem solving aptitude. There are always new frameworks and technologies, but they can be learned as long as you have a good understanding of systems and patterns. I enjoy solving problems and architecting solutions, but I am of the belief that it is important to stay pragmatic and to keep in perspective that you are solving a business problem.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## <a name = "drivers">Motivations and Background</a> 

Highly interested in technologies that bring about positive change. 

My passion for progressive technologies motivated me to apply my knowledge of mechanics to the biochemical engineering field for the final year project of my degree. Using the skills that I acquired from my Masters of Mechanical Engineering Degree and the knowledge I gained studying biomechanics during the summer, I built a [lung-on-a-chip](LINK).

Wanting to enact positive change, I sought out a career in sustainable development. Joining AECOM's building services team as an engineering consultant, I liaised with stakeholders and multidisciplinary teams to deliver energy efficient buildings on time, to spec, and on budget.

In the pursuit of a more challenging career, I decided upon Software engineering (and wrote a [blog](LINK) about what led my to this decision). TLDR: more challenging, greater variation in work, faster paced environment, young (and exciting) industry.
