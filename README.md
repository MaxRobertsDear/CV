## Max Roberts-Dear

#### Full Stack Developer

I am a keen technologist looking for new challenges and craving innovation. Although my core competencies are in JavaScript and Ruby, my main asset is my pragmatic problem solving aptitude. There are always new frameworks and technologies, but these can be learned if you have a good understanding of systems and patterns. I enjoy solving problems and architecting solutions and my years of experience as an engineering consultant have taught me the importance of keeping the business problem that you are trying to solve in perspective.



#### What I'm looking for in a job role

* Contribute from day 1. 
* Enact measurable change.
* See projects from concept to delivery.
* Face new challenges, regularly.

#### What I'm looking for in a team

* Collaborative environment - where alternative schools of thought are valued.
* Celebrated innovation -  through the sharing of new ideas with the wider tech community via Meetups. 
  * Not done currently? I have experience in organising events and would love to kickstart this.
* Technologically relevent - by staying up to date with the latest tools and industry best practice. 
  * I organised the Continual Professional Development at my previous firm, and would happily do so again.
* Social environment - I want to know the team members as more than colleagues. 
  * Not got a big drinking culture? That's fine. Climbing and white water rafting are just as fun!

#### Experience in the following industry best practices:

* **Agile:** [Acebook](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard) - Stand Ups, Sprints, Pair programming, Mobbing (see [Wiki](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard/wiki))
* **Test- Driven Development:** [Bank-Tech-Test](LINK) - Feature tests, Unit Tests, 100% Test Coverage
* **Unit Testing:** [Echo-Tech-Test](LINK) - Mocks, Stubs
* **Automated Testing & Deployment**  - [Acebook](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear/acebook-Isambard) - CICD using Travis and Heroku, respectively.



## <a name = "drivers">What Drives Me - Motivations and Background</a> 

Highly interested in technologies that bring about positive change. 

**Master's Final Year Project**  
My passion for progressive technologies led me to build a [lung-on-a-chip](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxrobertsdear/#experience-section) (Experience Section - Research Assistant.)

* Learning by context - I developed the skill of focussing my learning when faced with an unfamiliar discipline. 
* Prototyping - I fabricated a simple example to familiarise myself with the process before adding complexity. 
* Collaborative growth - though I completed the project alone, I reached out for guidance in lab methodologies. 

**Engineering Consultant**  
To enact positive change, I sought out a career in sustainable development. 

* Communication - I liaised with stakeholders and multi-disciplinary teams to deliver energy efficient buildings on time, to spec, and on budget.
* Presentation - I produced content for and presented at client meetings.
* Workshops -  I led the mechanical discipline at external project workshops with multi-disciplinary teams.

**New Challenge: Software Engineering**  
In the pursuit of a more challenging career, I decided upon Software engineering (and wrote a [blog post](LINK) about it). 
* TLDR: more challenging, greater variation in work, faster paced environment, young (and exciting) industry.



## <a name = "education">Education</a>


#### Software Engineering Course: Makers Academy (2019)

The self-led curriculum at Makers Academy developed my skills in applying a methodical approach to solving new problems using industry best practice. 


##### Methodologies

* [OOP](BLOGLINK), [TDD](BLOGLINK), [MVC](BLOGLINK)
* [Agile](BLOGLINK), [Extreme Programming](BLOGLINK)



#### MEng in Mechanical Engineering: University of Sheffield (September 2011 to June 2016)
| Module | Grade |
| :----: | :---: |
| Essential Mathematics Skills and Techniques | 1st |
| Computational Mathematics | 1st |
| Mathematics for Engineering Modelling | 1st |


* Cemented my aptitude for problem solving. 
* Strengthened my ability to break computational challenges down into simple steps.  
  * Exemplified by the high grades achieved across the board in Mathematics. 

This aptitude has served me well in algorithm design. I break the logic down into increasingly smaller steps. I continue this process until the code required to compute a step can be written on a single line (e.g. [Echo-Challenge](LINK)).



## <a name = "professionalExperience">Professional Experience</a>

#### Mechanical Engineering Consultant (London September 2016 to April 2019)
During my 2.5 years working as an engineering consultant at AECOM, ranked number 1 in the Engineering News Record, I liaised with clients and designed engineering solutions to meet the scope of their requirements.

- Collaborated with engineers, contractors and architects to design the mechanical infrastructure for commercial and residential building projects as well as mission-critical projects such as data centres.
- Developed models and calculations to carry out energy efficiency assessments and cost planning in order to deliver effective professional services and drive efficient solutions.
- Led mechanical design and built 3D models to support energy efficiency calculations and to communicate design intent to clients and architects.
- Chaired meetings with clients and workshops with other engineering disciplines to confirm project requirements.
