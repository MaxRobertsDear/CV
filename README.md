## Max Roberts-Dear

#### Full Stack Developer

I am a keen technologist looking for new challenges and craving innovation. Although my core competencies are in JavaScript and Ruby, my main asset is my pragmatic problem solving aptitude. There are always new frameworks and technologies, but these can be learned if you have a good understanding of systems and patterns. I enjoy solving problems and architecting solutions and my years of experience as an engineering consultant have taught me the importance of keeping the business problem that you are trying to solve in perspective.



#### What I'm looking for in a job role

* To contribute from day 1. 
* To enact measurable change.
* To see projects from concept to delivery.
* To face new challenges, regularly.

#### What I'm looking for in a team

* Collaborative environment - where alternative schools of thought are valued.
* Celebrated innovation -  through the sharing of new ideas with the wider tech community via Meetups. 
  * Not done currently? I have experience in organising events and would love to kickstart this.
* Technologically relevent - by staying up to date with the latest tools and industry best practice. 
  * I organised the Continual Professional Development at my previous firm, and would happily do so again.
* Social environment - I want to know the team members as more than colleagues. 
  * Not got a big drinking culture? That's fine. Climbing and white water rafting are just as fun!

## <a name = "drivers">What Drives Me - Motivations and Background</a> 

Highly interested in technologies that bring about positive change. 

My passion for progressive technologies motivated me to apply my knowledge of mechanics to the biochemical engineering field for the final year project of my degree. Using the skills that I acquired from my Masters of Mechanical Engineering course and the knowledge I gained studying biomechanics during the summer, I built a [lung-on-a-chip](LINK).

**Relevance to software engineering:** I developed the skill of learning by context. For example, I had never worked with human cells before and these formed an intrinsic part of my project. Knowing exactly what type of cells I needed and what I wanted to do with them (ensure good adhesion to a membrane that I fabricated using a laser as well as subject the cells to the mechanical forces that mimic the forces they would experience in the human body), I was able to acquire the knowledge I needed without having to read the whole book on cell biology. 

Wanting to enact positive change, I sought out a career in sustainable development. Joining AECOM's building services team as an engineering consultant, I liaised with stakeholders and multi-disciplinary teams to deliver energy efficient buildings on time, to spec, and on budget.

**Relevance to software engineering:** working to tight deadlines sharpened my communication skills within multi-disciplinary teams. My aptitude for communicating technical information to an audience without the relevant background was quickly recognised by my line-manager and resulted in me representing AECOM at client meetings and leading the mechanical discipline at workshops with architects, structural, and electrical engineers. 

In the pursuit of a more challenging career, I decided upon Software engineering (and wrote a [blog post](LINK) about what led my to this decision). TLDR: more challenging, greater variation in work, faster paced environment, young (and exciting) industry.

#### Software Engineering Course: Makers Academy (2019)

The self-led curriculum at Makers Academy developed my skills in applying a methodical approach to solving new problems using industry best practice. 


##### Methodologies

* OOP, TDD, MVC
* Agile, Extreme Programming



#### MEng in Mechanical Engineering: University of Sheffield (September 2011 to June 2016)
##### Software related modules: Essential Mathematics Skills and Techniques (Grade achieved: 1st), Computational Mathematics (Grade achieved: 1st), Mathematics for Engineering Modelling (Grade achieved: 1st)

* Cemented my aptitude for problem solving. 
* Strengthened my ability to break computational challenges down into simple steps.  
  * Exemplified by the high grades achieved across the board in Mathematics. 

This aptitude has served me well in algorithm design. I break the logic down into increasingly smaller steps. I continue this process until the code required to compute a step can be written on a single line (e.g. [Echo-Challenge](LINK)).



## <a name = "professionalExperience">Professional Experience</a>

#### Mechanical Engineering Consultant (London September 2016 to April 2019)
During my 2.5 years working as an engineering consultant at AECOM, ranked number 1 in the Engineering News Record, I liaised with clients and designed engineering solutions to meet the scope of their requirements.

- Collaborated with engineers, contractors and architects to design the mechanical infrastructure for commercial and residential building projects as well as mission-critical projects such as data centres.
- Developed models and calculations to carry out energy efficiency assessments and cost planning in order to deliver effective professional services and drive efficient solutions.
- Led mechanical design and built 3D models to support energy efficiency calculations and to communicate design intent to clients and architects.
- Chaired meetings with clients and workshops with other engineering disciplines to confirm project requirements.
